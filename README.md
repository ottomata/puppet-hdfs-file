Just parking this code here, it doesn't work.

I wanted to create a working Puppet HDFS file type, but getting into dealing with ensuring puppet content/source
was pretty difficult using hdfs dfs CLI commands.  To do this properly I'd need to integrate with
a Ruby HDFS client, but the ones out there seem pretty old and crufty.
